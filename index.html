                <li><b>New Interests</b></li>
                <p>Taking up new interests may not complement your current home decor. Let’s say you’ve developed a passion for baking but the space in your kitchen is too small to accommodate a large oven and baking utensils. To create your dream space, rearrange your kitchen furniture and appliances to work in favour of your newly developed interest.</p>

Your furniture and interior decoration should give you a light, calming, and happy feeling. When your saggy sofas, grubby walls, and rundown coffee table feels off, finding harmony between you and your home can be hard. If you feel like your home does not bring you joy anymore, take time to invest in creating a sanctuary where you can take refuge from all the stress.</p>
            </ul>
            <ul>
